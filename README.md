Agreeing to Disagree: Annotating Offensive Language Datasets with Annotatorsâ€™ Disagreement. *Elisa Leonardelli, Stefano Menini, Alessio Palmero Aprosio, Marco Guerini and Sara Tonelli*, In Proceedings of EMNLP 2021 (https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.822/)

In compliance with Twitter policy, the dataset is available for non-commercial research only (https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy) and cannot be used for any discriminatory purpose, event monitoring, profiling or targeting of individuals. 

The dataset, in the form of tweet IDs with accompanying annotation, **can be obtained upon request to the authors** by filling the following form: https://forms.gle/hBKTUbCR1zimNhicA.

Requestors will be asked to declare that they will not use the dataset to collect any sensitive category of personal information. 

The dataset contains more than 10k tweet IDs associated with 5 offensive/non-offensive labels from different annotators collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk (crowd-workers' IDs are not  included in the dataset).
